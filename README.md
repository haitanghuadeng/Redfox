### When it comes to development, I'm a little embarrassed myself.

<center>Because Redfox is not really developed, but based on pyecharts, for readers and the original Python scholars, as well as those who are going into the visual field, to redevelop.And I hope that Redfox will be able to face the world in the near future, just like anaconda.</center>
