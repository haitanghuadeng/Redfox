<h1> Secondary development based on pyecharts<h1>

<h4> When it comes to development, I'm a little embarrassed myself.
Because Redfox is not really developed, but based on pyecharts, for readers and the original Python scholars, as well as those who are going into the visual field, to redevelop.And I hope that Redfox will be able to face the world in the near future, just like anaconda.
