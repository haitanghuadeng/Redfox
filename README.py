# This is readme.py,Secondary development based on pyecharts.Thanks to the author of pyecharts!

# When it comes to development, I'm a little embarrassed myself.
# Because Redfox is not really developed, but based on pyecharts,
# for readers and the original Python scholars, as well as those who are going into the visual field, to redevelop.
# And I hope that Redfox will be able to face the world in the near future, just like anaconda.

# Salute to the python communityÔºÅ

# print("Hello! world!")
